The Country Flag Picker app demonstrates how to retrieve and display national flags using the country code entered by the user. This application:

1. Takes a two-letter country code as input (e.g., "us", "ca", "au")

2. Constructs a URL to the flagcdn.com API

3. Uses Coil3 to efficiently download and display the flag
